        "description": "'Kankaria Lake also known as Hauz e Qutub' is the second biggest lake in Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat, India. It is located in the southern part of the city, in the Maninagar area. A lakefront has been developed around it, which has many public attractions such as a zoo, toy train, kids city, tethered balloon ride, water rides, water park, food stalls, and entertainment facilities. The lakefront was revamped in 2008. Kankaria Carnival is a week-long festival held here in the last week of December. Many cultural, art, and social activities are organised during the carnival.\r\n\r\nKankaria Lake was built by Sultan Qutbuddin in the 15th century. The work was completed in 1451 CE and was known as \"Qutb Hauz\" or \"Hauz-i-Qutb\". It was used for bathing by the kings. It had a water purification system but it has been lost with the time. At one point of the circular lake, there opens a walkway which later merges into a garden called Nagina Wadi (which means beautiful garden in Urdu) that is located in the centre of the lake. With an approximate circumference of 3 miles (4.8 km), it represents the regale history of Ahmedabad. It is a 34-sided polygon having steps which leading down to water\r\n\r\nKamla Nehru Zoological Park was established by Rueben David in 1951 CE spread over 21 acres. It was rated the best zoo in Asia in 1974.[6] They are 450 mammals, 2,000 birds, 140 reptiles in a 31-acre zoo.

        "description": "The Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, built in 1573, is one of the most famous mosques of Ahmedabad. As attested by the marble tablet fixed on the wall of the mosque, it was built by Sidi Saeed or Sidi Saiyyed, an Abyssinian in the retinue of Bilal Jhajar Khan, general in the army of the last Sultan Shams-ud-Din Muzaffar Shah III of the Gujarat Sultanate.[1]\r\nSidi Saiyyed Mosque\r\n\r\nThe mosque was built in the last year of the existence of Sultanate of Gujarat.[1] The mosque is entirely arcuated and is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows (jalis) on the side and rear arches. The rear wall is filled with square stone pierced panels in geometrical designs. The two bays flanking the central aisle have reticulated stone slabs carved in designs of intertwined trees and foliage and a palm motif. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.\r\n\r\nThe central window arch of the mosque, where one would expect to see another intricate jali, is instead walled with stone.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Sabarmati Ashram (also known as Gandhi Ashram, Harijan Ashram, or Satyagraha Ashram) is located in the Sabarmati suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, adjoining the Ashram Road, on the banks of the River Sabarmati, four miles from the town hall. This was one of the residences of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, generally called Mahatma Gandhi, who lived there for about twelve years along with his wife, Kasturba Gandhi.\r\n\r\nIt was from his base here that Gandhi led the Dandi march also known as the Salt Satyagraha on 12 March 1930. In recognition of the significant influence that this march had on the Indian independence movement the Indian government has established the ashram as a national monument.\r\n\r\nGandhi's India ashram was originally established at the Kocharab Bungalow of Jivanlal Desai, a barrister and friend of Gandhi, on 25 May 1915. At that time the ashram was called the Satyagraha Ashram. But Gandhi wanted to carry out various activities such as farming and animal husbandry, in addition to other pursuits which called for the need of a much larger area of usable land. So two years later, on 17 June 1917, the ashram was relocated to an area of thirty-six acres on the banks of the river Sabarmati, and it came to be known as the Sabarmati Ashram.",

        "description": "Rani no Hajiro is located near Manek Chowk on east of the Ahmed Shah's Tomb. The enclosure is high above the ground entered by a lofty gateway and the courtyard surrounded by a trellised cloister. The walls of cloister are fitted with carved stone screens. The square open enclosure of 36.58 meters side is probably built in 1445. The courtyard contains eight marble tombs of queens of Ahmed Shah I and other Gujarat Sultanate rulers. They are elaborately carved and inlaid with work of mother-of-pearl and metal.\r\n\r\nThe principal tomb belongs to Mughalai Bibi, the wife of Muhammad Shah II and mother of Mahmud Begada. It is richly carved in white marble, and girt with a Persian inscription in minute relief. An adjacent tomb in black marble, once inlaid with mother-of-pearl, belongs to Mirki or Murki Bibi, the wife of Shah e Alam, the sister of queen and the daughter of Jam of Sindh. These tombs are covered with rich brocade works, the textile style developed during reign of Ahmed Shah I. The intricate stone tracery and carving is an amalgamation of Hindu, Jain, and Islamic architectural styles. Some Muslim families live inside complex which take care of the tombs",

        "description": "Sarkhej Roza is a mosque and tomb complex located in the village of Makarba, 7 km south-west of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, India. The complex is known as \"Acropolis of Ahmedabad\", due to 20th century architect Le Corbusier's famous comparison of this mosque's design to the Acropolis of Athens.[1]\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many rozas[2] across Gujarat, the Sarkhej Roza is the most revered. Sarkhej was once a prominent centre of Sufi culture in the country, where influential Sufi saint Shaikh Ahmed Ganj Baksh lived. It was on the saint's suggestion that Sultan Ahmed Shah set up his capital on the banks of the Sabarmati, a few miles away from Sarkhej.",

        "description": "Since its inception in 1956, the L.D. Institute of Indology has been collecting and preserving rare manuscripts and artifacts of various kinds, some of which are handed over to the L.D. Museum. The Museum is the product of the vision and energy of two remarkable persons who were responsible for its establishment: Muni Shri Punyavijayaji, an erudite monk scholar and Sheth Kasturbhai Lalbhai, the well-known industrialist of Ahmedabad. As the collection grew over the years, the Board of Trustees (of the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Bharatiya Sanskriti Vidyamandir), felt strongly the need for a separate museum building to house the display of its collection. Consequently, a new museum building was built adjacent to the existing building of the Institute, which was also designed by the internationally acclaimed architect, Shri Balkrishna Doshi. The collection in the new museum building was opened to the public in 1984 and was formally inaugurated by Shri Braj Kumar Nehru (Governor of Gujarat) in 1985.",
